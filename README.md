# Facial_recognition
Developed a deep learning model to perform facial emotion recognition using a dataset of 48x48 pixel grayscale images of faces. Implemented data preprocessing, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), data augmentation, and transfer learning techniques. Achieved a test accuracy of 65% on a multi-class emotion classification task
